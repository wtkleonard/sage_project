### Final Project Proposal

Here is my proposal for the final project of the course MATH480.

In probability, it is known that a tree can be coded by a real continuous function,
called the contour function. Conversely, any continuous function represents
a "real tree". I propose to write an algorithm that produces a tree out of 
a continuous function (with some approximation).
